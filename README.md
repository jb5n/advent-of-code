This repository contains my personal solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges.

At Stray Kite Studios, our programming team enjoys participating in Advent of Code together via a private leaderboard. While it's a friendly competition, your score is based on how quickly you complete the challenges, so the code here prioritizes quick problem-solving over clean architecture. As a result, you may find some less-than-serious commit messages and a few hacky implementations.

That said, many of these puzzles do require thoughtful optimization in order to get a result in a reasonable timeframe (think "naive implementation requires a `for` loop iterating over 1 billion times"), so thereâ€™s plenty of real problem-solving throughout.
